# MobWear
A Smartphone Customization App

### About

MobWear is a cross-platform application that allows its users to express their creativity and style by applying various combinations of colors and textures to their favorite smartphones.
The app currently has a catalogue of thirty-two phones from three of the world’s major smartphone makers with more on the way. MobWear allows its users to capture their customized phones on selected color, textured or image backgrounds and share their customizations with the world. There’s also a bonus feature to view the specs of the smartphones.

### Smartphone Catalogue

MobWear has a (currently incomplete) catalogue of smartphones from ten of the world’s major smartphone manufacturers. Each phone is built from scratch allowing maximum integration with the customization framework of the app. Having the phones built within the app also allows the phones to be animated to give them life.
